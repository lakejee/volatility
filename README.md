# ⚡ Volatility

A Binding of Isaac-style roguelike where killing enemies drops shards you can burn for power — but power makes everything harder.

## Core Loop

```
Kill Enemies → Collect Shards → Convert to Volatility → Get Stronger + Enemies Get Harder
```

**The tension:** Volatility buffs your damage, fire rate, and speed — but also buffs enemies. And it decays over time unless you keep killing. Risk vs reward, every room.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| WASD | Move |
| Arrow Keys | Shoot (4-direction) |
| Space (hold) | Convert shards → Volatility |

## Project Status

**Target:** 4 months @ 10 hrs/week → shippable V1 on itch.io
